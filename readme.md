# Accounts-Feedly
Meteor is awesome right. So is Feedly. Why aren't they in love? Now they are! With a simple ring to bind them you too can experience the joy of Feedly authentication.

## Dependencies
This package also requires its sister package which you can pull from atmosphere with d2tstudio:feedleor. In this case, it really *does* take two to tango. (i.e. a solo tango-er won't work.)

## Not to blame
I'm a designer right, not an awe-inspiring programmer - so if you find bugs you are welcome to help me fix them. I tested it, and it worked. But you know how it is, different environments etc. In short, if I can help I will. Tweet me @derrybirkett

Onwards, to glory!
